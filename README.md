# Deep-Learning-BLRSSM
This work includes the application of the ANN using Keras to conduct the parameter scan for the universal case of the BLRSSM SUSY model within the realm of the beyond the standard model phenomenology. The model has been traind based on 1 million points in a multi-dimensional space and then has been used to predict the relic density of each set of solutions. So that we have a faster approach to conduct the parameter scan rather than running SPheno and micrOMEGAS in row which drains a huge time and considerable computational resources. This model ended up resulting in a benchmark that could not be found using the direct search with the mentioned packages.
